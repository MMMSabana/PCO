# Pulse-Coupled Oscillators: Firefly Synchronization Simulation

## Abstract
This project implements a biological simulation of self-organization in decentralized systems, based on the **Mirollo-Strogatz model** (1990). It demonstrates how a population of coupled oscillators (agents) can achieve global phase synchronization through local interactions, mimicking the behavior of *Pteroptyx malaccae* fireflies.

The simulation utilizes a **Toroidal topology** to approximate an infinite medium and eliminate boundary effects, ensuring mathematically accurate convergence.

## Theoretical Background

### 1. Integrate-and-Fire Mechanism
Each agent $i$ is modeled as an oscillator with a phase variable $\theta_i \in [0, 1]$.
The phase evolves over time according to a natural frequency $\omega_i$:
$$ \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i $$
When $\theta_i$ reaches the threshold ($1.0$), the oscillator "fires" (flashes) and resets $\theta_i$ to $0$.

### 2. Excitatory Coupling
When oscillator $i$ fires, it sends a pulse to all neighbors $j$ within a radius $R$. The neighbors adjust their phase instantaneously:
$$ \theta_j(t^+) = \theta_j(t) + \varepsilon $$
Where $\varepsilon$ is the **Coupling Strength**. If the adjustment pushes $\theta_j \ge 1.0$, oscillator $j$ also fires immediately, creating an **avalanche effect**.

### 3. Refractory Period
To ensure biological plausibility and system stability, a refractory period is implemented. Agents are insensitive to external stimuli immediately after firing ($\theta < \theta_{ref}$), preventing signal feedback loops and chaotic "stuttering."

## Implementation Details

- **Topology:** Toroidal Manifold (Periodic Boundary Conditions). Distance is calculated as the shortest path on a torus surface:
  $$ d(x, y) = \min(|x_1 - x_2|, W - |x_1 - x_2|) $$
- **Synchronization Logic:** Synchronous update loop with an event stack to handle intra-frame signal propagation.
- **Heterogeneity:** Agents have variance in their natural frequencies ($\omega \pm \delta$), making exact synchronization non-trivial and robust.
