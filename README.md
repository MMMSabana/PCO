## 📋 Description

PCO is an implementation of the Mirollo-Strogatz model for Pulse-Coupled Oscillators in Python. It simulates the amazing coordination of Pteroptyx malaccae fireflies using a unique toroidal layout and integrate-and-fire mechanisms. This software allows you to visualize the emergent synchronization behavior in an engaging way.

## ✅ Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Navigate easily with a user-friendly design.
- **Realistic Simulation**: Watch fireflies synchronize in real-time.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Experiment with different settings to see how they affect synchronization.
- **Visual Feedback**: See clear graphical representations of the synchronization process.
- **Educational Insights**: Learn about complex systems and biomimicry concepts.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

## 🕹️ Using PCO

Once you open PCO, you will see the main interface.

### Explore the Features:

- **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to launch the firefly synchronization.
- **Adjust Settings**: Use the sliders to modify parameters like coupling strength and number of oscillators. Observing how these changes affect the simulation can be insightful.
- **Pause and Reset**: Use the "Pause" button to stop the simulation temporarily, and "Reset" to return to the beginning.

### Visual Feedback

You will see the fireflies represented as dots on the screen. As they begin to synchronize, you’ll notice their movements aligning over time, showcasing an example of emergent behavior in nature.

## 📚 Learn More

If you're curious about the science behind what you see, consider exploring:
